# MisOPlay
  This app helps you to find out top rated artists in every country and gives you information about them.

# Description
  If you ever wanted to know which artists are popular in some country and figure out which genre is actually popular, then this app is perfect for you! 
  
  For creating this app I used SwiftUI because iOS is the most popular right now so making native application is more interesting because it gives you more flexibilities and much more options to creat app.
  
  Since this is my first project in SwifUI I have been faced with a lot of challenges as getting pictures from url (https://www.last.fm/api/show/geo.getTopArtists) because of unusual coding key in JSON file, but after all I figure out all that. Also the real challenge was cach respons from country API. I am using package (CachyKit) 
  
  For me this is just begining in SwifUI and I know that there is a lot of place for upgrade but I hope that you like it!
